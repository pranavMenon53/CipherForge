# 🔐 CipherForge
**Because secure connections shouldn’t be boring.**

---

## 📖 About This Project
CipherForge is a **hands-on, deep dive** into the world of SSL/TLS.
We’ll explore how secure connections really work — from **the first handshake** to **the last cipher byte** — and break down tricky concepts with **real code, diagrams, and a little humor**.

If you’ve ever wondered *what actually happens* when you see that 🔒 in your browser, you’re in the right place.
