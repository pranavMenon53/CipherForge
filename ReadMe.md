# 🔐 CipherForge
**Because secure connections shouldn’t be boring.**

---

## 📖 About This Project
CipherForge is a **hands-on, deep dive** into the world of SSL/TLS.
We’ll explore how secure connections really work — from **the first handshake** to **the last cipher byte** — and break down tricky concepts with **real code, diagrams, and a little humor**.

If you’ve ever wondered *what actually happens* when you see that 🔒 in your browser, you’re in the right place.

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn
- **TLS/SSL Basics** — but with context that actually makes sense
- **The Handshake Process** — step-by-step, packet-by-packet
- **Ciphers & Encryption** — symmetric vs. asymmetric, AEAD, and more
- **Certificate Chains** — roots, intermediates, and trust stores
- **PKI Internals** — how the web of trust is built
- **Session Resumption** — because speed matters
- **Real-World SSL Debugging** — with `openssl` and Wireshark

# Getting started

1. Read the **Introduction to HTTPS** document ([here](./Introduction%20to%20SSL.docx)) to get started.
    - It is a good introduction to how TLS provides security for communications on the network and how it achieves it.
2. Once you read that, you can read the summary for TLS 1.2 using RSA ([here](./TLS-1.2-deep-dive.txt))
    - This is a quick summary that walks over the steps involved in TLS 1.2 using RSA.
